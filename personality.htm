<p2 style="font-size:180%;color:hsl(60, 100%, 75%);"><strong>Result of an online learning style test: </strong>Visual learner 40%/tactile learner 35%</p2>

<p3 style="font-size:180%;color:hsl(80, 100%, 75%);"><strong>Result of big 5 online personality test: </strong>Openness to experience – Low characteristic</p3>
<p4 style="font-size:180%;color:hsl(100, 100%, 70%);">                                         Extraversion – Medium Characteristic</p4>
<p5 style="font-size:180%;color:hsl(125, 100%, 72%);">                                         Neuroticism – Low Characteristic</p5>


<p6 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(148, 100%, 72%);">   The test results from the above online tests seem to be very accurate. I believe myself to be an ISFJ-T(Defender) and Visual learner,</p6>
<p7 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(170, 100%, 65%);">   not very open to new experiences, quite Extravert and have control over my emotions. As an ISFJ-T I am Hardworking and devoted, with a strong sense of responsibility.</p7>
<p8 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(195, 100%, 68%);">   I Provide care and support of my friends and family, with a strong eye for detail. I have always through I was a visual learner, but I also learn well with hands on experience.</p8>
<p9 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(215, 100%, 70%);">   I Generally like to stay with in my comfort zone, though I do like to try new things sometimes. As an extravert, I can gain energy from being social, but also from being alone.</p9>
<p10 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(235, 100%, 75%);">   It really depends on what the social event is and on the other hand going for a walk alone with some music is great. I feel that I have good control over my emotions in most situations, which realtes to Neuroticism.</p10>


<p11 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(260, 100%, 78%);">   The results of these tests show that in a team I can be counted to meet deadlines, will work well in a team due to my well-developed people skills, and that I probably will not seek recognition of the effort I put in.</p11>
<p12 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(280, 100%, 78%);">   I should be able to keep cool and work well under pressure and time restraints, attending meetings will most likely cause some level of anxiety and use a lot of energy.</p12>
<p13 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(300, 100%, 80%);">   When forming a team, I should look for others like me; people that are aware of the deadlines. People in the team should understand each other’s boundaries and limits to not over stimulate or reduce each other’s energy.</p13>
<p14 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(320, 100%, 80%);">   Having a more collaboratory group where we all work together instead of competing. Though there should be one designated leader as all groups should.</p14>
<p15 style="font-size:120%;color:hsl(340, 100%, 84%);">   This will provide me with the best possible group environment so we can all produce the best project we can.</p15>
