<p9 style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(215, 100%, 70%);">My interest in IT has been slowly growing since I was younger playing games on my home computer when I was around 12-13. When the pandemic first started affecting Australia,</p9>
<p10 style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(235, 100%, 75%);">I lost my full-time job. I struggled to find a career path that I wanted to follow, then I stumbled into the job trainer program and jumped at the chance to study cyber security.</p10>

<p15 style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(340, 100%, 84%);">I chose RMIT as I found that the online model of learning suited me better than on campus. I enrolled through online universityâ€™s Australia and RMIT is the university that they do it through.</p15>
<p16 style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(0, 100%, 80%);">RMIT is a highly regarded university when it comes to IT, so employers will look at a degree from RMIT favourably. I expect to learn a range of aspects of IT:</p16>
