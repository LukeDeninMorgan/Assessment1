    <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(125, 100%, 72%);">I am 28, born and raised in Byron Bay, a hardcore gamer and very interested in cyber security. Technically I have played Dota2 competitively, but didnt get very far.</p>
    <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(148, 100%, 72%);">  I recently attained my Certificate IV in cyber security at Tafe QLD. Im looking forward to learning more about IT and Cyber Security! I am studying towards my bachelor's in information Technology.</p>

      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(215, 100%, 70%);">My interest in IT has been slowly growing since I was younger playing games on my home computer when I was around 12-13. When the pandemic first started affecting Australia,</p>
      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(235, 100%, 75%);">I lost my full-time job. I struggled to find a career path that I wanted to follow, then I stumbled into the job trainer program and jumped at the chance to study cyber security.</p>
      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(260, 100%, 78%);">Ever since starting my Certificate IV in cyber security, I have been very interested and seeking a career in Cyber security.</p>
      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(280, 100%, 78%);">I gained Firsthand experience using various cyber security tools in assessments such as: Creating multiple virtual machines set up on one physical computer so I could simulate</p>
      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(300, 100%, 80%);">a man in the middle attack to grab unencrypted credentials with Wireshark, creating and preforming a red vs blue incident response team exercise.</p>
      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(320, 100%, 80%);">These hands on assessments really drove my hunger to continue to learn more about IT and cyber security. I have no formal IT work experience.</p>
      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(340, 100%, 84%);">I chose RMIT as I found that the online model of learning suited me better than on campus. I enrolled through online universityâ€™s Australia and RMIT is the university that they do it through.</p>
      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(0, 100%, 80%);">RMIT is a highly regarded university when it comes to IT, so employers will look at a degree from RMIT favourably. I expect to learn a range of aspects of IT:</p>
      <p style="font-size:100%;color:hsl(25, 100%, 75%);">More in depth programming skills; better ways at communicating to co-workers/clients; Cyber security; Data science; Networking; Business Analytics and more!</p>
