I am motivated to create this project as I am very interested in cyber security and penetration testing. Creating the documentation and processes will be interesting. If the project is successful, it may become my business or a business model I will adapt in a business I may create in the future. As Physical/Environmental, internal, and social engineering security is often overlooked, having a business’s focus around those weaker points will fill a gap in the market and overall strengthen the visibility of those exploits and vulnerabilities.
Description
The project is a business model that performs companywide penetration testing but specialling in Physical/Environmental and internal threats. So that means, that a client will receive web; network; internal; external; white; grey; and black box penetration testing but will have their physical/environmental and internal security scrutinised. The way we test internal threat protection is by using an “accomplice”. The “accomplice” is a current employee that receives a paid incentive to preform actions on our behalf. We first start will a small task, such as find a window that can open, and will increase the threat of the action (We will never ask the accomplice to damage or remove anything that will harm the business in any way and will only use photo evidence when presenting findings). The accomplice may also aid us in leaving security doors open for our technicians to gain access, this is where the need for the combination of physical and internal security becomes apparent.
If our operation scope is as we recommend (1 year service, and all areas of penetration testing). We will plan at least 1 attack a month minimum, where we attempt to gain access to any valuable resources, gain entry to restricted areas, gain access to the internal network, use our accomplice to aid us in the breach though most likely we will use a combination of them to have the most effect. After each attempt, we list areas that were vulnerable or areas we were able to breach or where the accomplice had access. If these vulnerabilities are with in the acceptable level indicated in the scope, they will only be recorded and used later by our team. If the vulnerabilities are outside of acceptable levels, they will be immediately reported to the company and not used for farther testing.

Tools and Technologies
Our company uses social engineering through social media and other publicly accessible websites. Depending on how the complexity of the client company’s security, we may use the following to attempt a breach: public physical access, using stolen credentials at check points or to gain access to secure locations or resources, using social engineering to try pass as employees or third parties to gain access. We may also use RFID badge/ID card signal duplicators to trick sensors to gain access. We will need to have our go bags ready with a laptop running windows/Kali Linux tooled up to collect any unencrypted credentials or to access the network physically or via wireless; port sniffing; vulnerability scanning; website spidering etc.

Skills required
Business skills and knowledge, client management and communication skills, network knowledge and skills, Strong social engineering skills. Our technicians will also need to have some physical capability as they may need to climb fences or squeeze in tight spaces. Also, all penetration testing skills (physical, environmental, web, network, internal, external, social engineering).

Outcome
The expected outcome from this project is to see if this business model would be viable, if it would be able to penetrate the market and be lucrative. If
